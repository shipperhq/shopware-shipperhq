## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### All Shipping Methods Are Shown at Checkout (Including Unavailable Ones)

**Issue:**
At checkout, every shipping method appears, even those that should not be available. When selecting an unavailable method, you may see an error such as:

```
USPS Priority Mail is blocked for your current shopping cart
```

**Solution:**
1. Go to the ShipperHQ app settings in Shopware.
2. Click the **Reload Shipping Methods** button.
3. Clear the Shopware cache:
   ```bash
   bin/console cache:clear
   ```

This will refresh the list of available shipping methods and resolve the error.
